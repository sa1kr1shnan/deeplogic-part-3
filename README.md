Part 3: Debugging and Improving Extraction Logic
Approach:

Developed a robust function to extract invoice amounts.
Implemented multiple strategies to handle different formats.
Created comprehensive test cases to verify functionality.

Challenges:

Handling various formats of amount representation (numeric, currency symbol, words).
Dealing with potential missing or malformed data.

Solution:

Used regex for flexible matching of numeric amounts.
Implemented word-to-number conversion for amounts in words.
Added fallback to "N/A" for missing data.

Key Code Section:
python
def extract_invoice_amount(value_content):
    if not value_content:
        return "N/A"
    
    # Try to find a monetary value in the string
    amount_match = re.search(r'\$?\s*\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d{2})?', value_content)
    if amount_match:
        return amount_match.group().strip('$ ')
    
    # Check for amount in words
    words_match = re.search(r'(?:Amount|Total).*?:\s*(.*)', value_content, re.IGNORECASE)
    if words_match:
        try:
            return str(w2n.word_to_num(words_match.group(1)))
        except ValueError:
            pass
    
    return "N/A"

Test case
    
def test_extract_invoice_amount():
    assert extract_invoice_amount("Total Amount: $500") == "500"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("Amount: 500") == "500"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("Amount Due: 500.00") == "500.00"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("Total: $1,234.56") == "1,234.56"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("Amount: Five Hundred") == "500"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("") == "N/A"
    assert extract_invoice_amount("No amount here") == "N/A"
